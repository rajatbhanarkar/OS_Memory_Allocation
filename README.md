Problem Definition:
Given Dataset of 1 to N numbers and M bins of capacity C (Numbered 1 to M), use First fit and Best fit OS Memory Allocation Algorithms to demonstrate the data in each bins with efficient searching of data in bins. Also analyze memory wastage and full capacity bins left.

App Flow:

Initial Conditions: 
  Data: 1 to 500
  Bins: 1 to 100
  Bin Capacity: 1500 (1500/1500 = FULL, 0/1500 = EMPTY)
  
1) Select the algorithm: First Fit / Best Fit
2) Results of analyzed memory allocation is displayed
3) Enter the data to be searched
4) On clicking Search icon, the bins will scroll to the bin containing the data and the bin will be highlighted
5) To verify the data, long press on highlighted bin and all data present in the bin is displayed
6) You can anytime long press a bin to view its data
7) Incase you want to change the initial conditions as mentioned above, click on settings icon on the top
